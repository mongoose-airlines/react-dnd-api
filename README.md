________________________________________________
Thursday POA:

We have the handling input in react lesson (dev skills) scheduled for this day
https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEI-CC/SEI-CC-7/blob/master/work/w10/d5/01-handling-input-in-react.md


- Searching with spells works REALLY well.  (if you leave it blank, it returns everything)
- Input in React again.  That's good, no?
- Yeah I think this works... Really short day compared to Wednesday though
- Event Handling
  - Connecting handlers (methods) to events
  - Passing Event handlers to Children components
  - Context Binding

NOTES FOR WHEN YOU GET BACK:
ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘”
- We still need a little more detail on the monsters page.
- Once we get the search page done, we'll need to do MINIMAL styling
- I'd REALLY love to have funny images for the classes, but that's a stretch.
- I removed match and history from the render on App.js because we're not using them.
- We should not be using 'import * as API from .....' if we're only importing one thing (I refactored this, but wanted to let you know)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
